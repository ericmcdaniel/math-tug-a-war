## Purpose
This is a full-stack web application designed, architected, developed, tested, documented, and deployed as a Fall '23 semester-long group project for the University of Illinois - Springfield's CSC 478 Software Engineering Capstone.

The Math Tug-a-War is a fast-paced single-player game that helps students, hobbyists, children, and math enthusiasts compete in a controlled environment for the highest score possible. Users are given the ability to select their preferred difficulty level, ranging from easy to hard. Users must answer these rapid-fire questions as quickly as possible before the timer expires. The game concludes after ten questions have been completed, and the user can see their score.
